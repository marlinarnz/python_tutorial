# Python and pandas tutorial
Quick tutorials for getting to know Python syntax and basic pandas usage.

## Setup

This tutorial requires two very common tools in open source contextes: `git` and `Jupyter notebooks`. Please consider watching some tutorials, if you haven't heard about them yet. The Anaconda environment comes with both tools and will be handy in the future. 
Download and install it to your computer as described here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

Open the Anaconda command line and navigate to the folder where you want to work on the tutorials. 
Clone this repository to your local computer: type into the commad line `git clone <this repo's URL>`

The `pandas` library is not pre-installed on Anaconda. Thus, in the Anaconda command line, enter `conda install -c anaconda pandas`.

## Tutorials

There are three tutorials with different contents:
* `basic_py`: Introduction to Python syntax and concepts
* `function_inout`: Introduction to functions and their syntax in Python (as Jupyter notebooks)
* `pandas_intro`: Introduction to the pandas library's syntax and its functions (as Jupyter notebook)

For the first tutorial, open the exercise in a text editor of your choice (e.g. Notepad++). Type your solution into the file. In the command line, navigate to the exercise folder and run your code by entering `python <name of your file.py>`. Note: You can comment out whole sections using this syntax: `"""long comment"""`

The second and third tutorial come in the form of Jupyter notebooks. To open and edit them, navigate to the exercise folder in your Anaconda command line and enter `jupyter notebook`, which will start the interface in your standard browser. It depicts your local file structure at the root where you navigated to in the command line and allows you running the notebooks.

You also find a cheat sheet with useful Python syntax.
